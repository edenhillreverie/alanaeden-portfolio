<h1>About</h1>

<p>
I am an artist working primarily in digital painting, exploring atmosphere, light, and quiet emotional landscapes.
</p>

<p>
My work often begins abstractly and develops toward place, focusing on stillness, transition, and presence rather than narrative.
</p>

<p>
This portfolio is forming gradually. New work is added as it is completed.
